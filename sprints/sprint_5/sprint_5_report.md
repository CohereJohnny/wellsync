# Sprint 5 Report

## Sprint Overview
Sprint 5 focused on implementing filtering capabilities for the WellSync AI Dashboard. The main goal was to enable users to filter wells by Camp, Formation, and Status through an intuitive toolbar interface.

## Key Achievements

### 1. Toolbar Implementation
- Created a responsive toolbar component using Shadcn/UI
- Implemented three filter dropdowns: Camp, Formation, and Status
- Added proper state management using URL parameters
- Ensured filter values match data model specifications

### 2. Filter Functionality
- Implemented client-side filter state management
- Added URL parameter synchronization for shareable filtered views
- Created proper filter reset functionality
- Added loading states and empty states for better UX

### 3. API Integration
- Updated Supabase query builder to handle filter parameters
- Implemented proper case handling for database queries
- Added error handling for invalid filter values
- Optimized query performance with conditional filter application

### 4. Bug Fixes
- Resolved Select component empty value error (BUG-001)
- Fixed filter value mismatches with data model (BUG-002)
- Implemented proper case and hyphenation handling

## Testing Summary
All test cases from the test plan were executed successfully:
- Single filter operations (Camp, Formation, Status)
- Combined filter operations
- URL parameter synchronization
- Browser navigation
- Loading and empty states
- Error handling

## Technical Debt
No significant technical debt was introduced during this sprint.

## Lessons Learned
1. Importance of aligning UI component values with database schema
2. Value of URL-based state management for filter persistence
3. Need for proper case handling in database queries

## Next Steps
As we move into Sprint 6, we should focus on:
1. Implementing fault simulation functionality
2. Setting up real-time status updates
3. Integrating with the Supabase Realtime subscription system

## Demo Notes
The filtering system can be demonstrated by:
1. Selecting individual filters to show basic filtering
2. Combining multiple filters to show advanced filtering
3. Using browser navigation to show URL parameter persistence
4. Showing empty states when no results match filters
