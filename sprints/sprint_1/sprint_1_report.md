**Sprint Goal:** Finalize and confirm the initial WellSync AI project setup according to specifications and Sprint 1 plan. Ensure all necessary configuration files, dependencies, and sprint tracking files are correctly in place.

**Summary:**
Sprint 1 successfully established the foundational project structure and configuration for WellSync AI. Core Next.js files, configuration (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, `.env.local`, etc.), and dependencies were created and installed. The initial sprint documentation structure was also set up. The project builds successfully.

**Completed Tasks:**
*   [x] Create `package.json` with initial scripts and dependencies.
*   [x] Create `tsconfig.json` with Next.js configuration.
*   [x] Create `tailwind.config.js` with content paths and custom theme.
*   [x] Create `postcss.config.js`.
*   [x] Create `next.config.js`.
*   [x] Create `.eslintrc.json`.
*   [x] Create `.gitignore`.
*   [x] Create `app/` directory.
*   [x] Create `app/globals.css`.
*   [x] Create `app/layout.tsx`.
*   [x] Run `pnpm install` to install dependencies.
*   [x] Create `app/page.tsx`.
*   [x] Create `.env.local` with placeholders.
*   [x] Create `sprints/sprint_1` directory.
*   [x] Manually update `sprints/sprint_1/sprint_1_tasks.md` with this task list.
*   [x] (Optional) Create `sprints/sprint_1/sprint_1_testplan.md`.

**Notes from `sprint_1_tasks.md`:**
*   This sprint focused on manual creation of the initial project structure.
*   Dependencies successfully installed via `pnpm install`.
*   Linter errors in `tsconfig.json` resolved after creating `.tsx` files and running `pnpm install`.
*   Missing `autoprefixer` dev dependency identified during `pnpm run build` and installed.

**Sprint Review Notes:**
*   **Demo Readiness:** Basic project structure established. App builds successfully after adding `autoprefixer`.
*   **Gaps/Issues:** Minor issue with missing dev dependency (`autoprefixer`) identified and resolved during build check.
*   **Next Steps:** Ready to proceed to Sprint 2 (Supabase Schema Definition).
