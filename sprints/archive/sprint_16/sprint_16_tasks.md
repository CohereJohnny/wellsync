# Sprint 16 Tasks: MCP Server - Python Environment Setup

## Goal
Prepare the Python development environment within the `/mcp` directory for the MCP server.

## Tasks

- [x] Create Python virtual environment (e.g., `.venv`) in `/mcp`.
- [x] Install necessary base dependencies (`supabase-py`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`/`httpx`).
- [x] Install MCP SDK dependencies (`pip install mcp`, `pip install git+https://github.com/abdullahkady/python-sdk.git` for AuthorizedMCP).
- [x] Configure `.env` file loading for Supabase/other credentials within `/mcp`.
- [x] Set up `.gitignore` for Python environment files in `/mcp`.
- [x] Basic validation of environment and Supabase client connection within `/mcp`.

## Sprint Review
- **Demo Readiness**: N/A (Environment setup sprint).
- **Gaps/Issues**: MCP server failed to start due to port conflict (Errno 48 - address already in use on port 3003), but this did not impact the sprint goal of environment validation.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 17 to implement MCP tools and resources.
