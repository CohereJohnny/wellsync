# Sprint 16 Report: MCP Server - Python Environment Setup

## Goal Achieved
The Python development environment within the `/mcp` directory for the MCP server was successfully prepared and validated.

## Completed Tasks

- Created Python virtual environment (`.venv`) in `/mcp`.
- Installed necessary base dependencies (`supabase-py`, `python-dotenv`, `httpx`).
- Installed MCP SDK dependencies (`pip install mcp`, `pip install git+https://github.com/abdullahkady/python-sdk.git`).
- Configured `.env` file loading for Supabase/other credentials within `/mcp`.
- Set up `.gitignore` to exclude Python environment files in `/mcp`.
- Validated the environment by running the `mcp/wellsync.py` script, confirming successful Supabase connection using loaded credentials.

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: N/A (Environment setup sprint).
- **Gaps/Issues**: An initial attempt to run the server script failed due to port 3003 being in use. This was resolved by the user, and subsequent execution confirmed successful environment validation and server startup.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 17 to implement MCP tools and resources.
