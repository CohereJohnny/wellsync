# Sprint 13 Report

## Sprint Goal
Enable part ordering and dispatching workflows through the GenAI assistant using Cohere tool calling.

## Completed Tasks

### Tool Schema Definition (`/api/chat`)
- Defined JSON schemas for `order_part` (params: `part_id`, `quantity`, `destination_well_id`) and `dispatch_part` (params: `part_id`, `quantity`, `source_warehouse_id`, `destination_well_id`).
- Updated `/api/chat` to pass these tool definitions to the Cohere API call and switched model to `command-a-03-2025` (reverting previous incorrect change).

### Backend Order Simulation (`/api/orders`)
- Created `app/api/orders/route.ts` with a `POST` handler.
- Implemented request body validation and basic error handling.
- Added logging to simulate order placement.
- Returns a standard success JSON response.

### Backend Dispatch Simulation (`/api/dispatches`)
- Created `app/api/dispatches/route.ts` with a `POST` handler.
- Implemented request body validation and error handling.
- Set up Supabase client.
- Implemented logic to query `inventory` table, check `stock_level` against requested `quantity`, and update `stock_level` via Supabase `update` if sufficient.
- Returns success or error (e.g., 404 Not Found, 409 Conflict for insufficient stock) JSON response.

### Tool Call Integration (`/api/chat`)
- Modified `/api/chat` to handle tool calls:
    - Detects `toolCalls` in the initial Cohere response.
    - Uses `fetch` to call `/api/orders` or `/api/dispatches` based on the tool name and parameters.
    - Collects results (success/error messages) from the simulation APIs.
    - Formats results into the `toolResults` structure required by Cohere.
    - Makes a second call to `cohere.chat`, providing the `toolResults` and correctly structured chat history (including the first assistant turn with `toolCalls`), to get the final natural language response.
    - Handles errors during simulation API calls.
- Resolved TypeScript errors related to Cohere response types using type assertions (`NonStreamedChatResponse`, `Message`).

### Testing
- Tested `/api/orders` endpoint directly via `curl` (valid and invalid requests).
- Tested `/api/dispatches` endpoint directly via `curl` (valid dispatch, insufficient stock, invalid request).
- Tested tool call integration via the frontend chat UI:
    - Verified `order_part` trigger and successful confirmation message.
    - Verified `dispatch_part` trigger (success case) and successful confirmation message (including new stock level). Verified inventory update in DB.
    - Verified `dispatch_part` trigger (failure case - insufficient stock) and failure confirmation message.
- Deferred testing of multiple simultaneous tool calls and specific API error handling scenarios to Tech Debt.

### Documentation
- Created documentation for the `/api/orders` endpoint (`docs/api_orders.md`).
- Created documentation for the `/api/dispatches` endpoint (`docs/api_dispatches.md`).
- Created documentation for the Cohere tool schemas (`docs/tool_schemas.md`).
- Created documentation for the `/api/chat` endpoint, detailing the tool call flow (`docs/api_chat.md`).

## Incomplete Tasks / Deferred Items
- Testing for multiple simultaneous tool calls.
- Testing for specific API error handling scenarios (e.g., simulation API down) (TD-003).

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: The chat assistant can now handle requests to order and dispatch parts using Cohere tool calling. It interacts with simulated backend APIs, checks inventory for dispatches, and provides natural language confirmations of success or failure.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Backend actions are simulations. Some specific error handling tests and multiple tool call tests were deferred.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 14 (Real-time Inventory & UI Polish).
