# Sprint 15 Report

## Goal Achieved
Conducted thorough end-to-end testing, finalized documentation review, and performed code cleanup, preparing the application for a v1.0.0 release.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Manual)
- **Homescreen Flow**: Verified initial load, filtering, navigation.
- **Fault Simulation Flow**: Tested dialog, submission, toast notification, status updates, and fault history appearance.
- **Well Detail & Chat Flow**: Validated info display, fault history table, chat messaging, history persistence, semantic search, and tool calling (`order_part`, `dispatch_part` success/failure cases), and Realtime fault updates.

### 2. Cross-Browser & Responsiveness Testing (Manual)
- *Skipped as per user request.*

### 3. Performance Validation (Manual)
- *Skipped as per user request.*

### 4. Documentation Review
- **README.md**: Reviewed and confirmed setup instructions, application description, and technology stack are up-to-date.
- **Specification Documents**: Reviewed (noting they were mostly addressed in S14).

### 5. Code Review & Cleanup
- Reviewed codebase for clarity and consistency.
- Removed unnecessary `console.log` statements and minor commented-out code.
- Ensured environment variables are handled correctly and created `.env.example`.
- Checked for obvious performance bottlenecks (minor lint warning noted).
- Ran `pnpm run build` successfully.

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: The application is fully functional and feature-complete according to the v1.0.0 plan. All major user flows and technical integrations are operational.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Formal cross-browser and performance testing were deferred. A minor ESLint warning related to `useEffect` dependencies in `ChatPanel` was observed during the build. Known items exist in the backlog and tech debt logs.
- **Next Steps**: Archive Sprint 15, proceed with v1.0.0 release steps, and begin planning Sprint v1.1.0.
