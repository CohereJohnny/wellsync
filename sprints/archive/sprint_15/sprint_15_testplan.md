# Sprint 15 Test Plan

## Goal
Verify the end-to-end functionality, cross-browser compatibility, performance, and documentation of the WellSync AI demo application.

## Test Areas & Approach

This sprint focuses on manual testing and review rather than specific, granular test cases. The approach involves executing typical user workflows and validating application behavior across different environments.

### 1. End-to-End (E2E) Workflow Testing
- **Objective**: Validate the core user journeys from start to finish.
- **Workflows to Test** (Refer to `sprint_15_tasks.md` for detailed steps):
  - Homescreen loading and filtering.
  - Fault simulation and real-time status update on homescreen.
  - Navigation to Well Detail view.
  - Viewing well details and fault history (including sorting/expanding).
  - Basic chat interaction and history persistence.
  - Semantic search via chat.
  - Tool calling workflows (`order_part`, `dispatch_part` success/failure) via chat.
  - Real-time inventory update confirmation (console log).
- **Method**: Manual execution of workflows, observing UI behavior and assistant responses.

### 2. Cross-Browser & Responsiveness Testing
- **Objective**: Ensure consistent appearance and functionality across supported browsers and screen sizes.
- **Browsers**: Latest stable versions of Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge.
- **Screen Sizes**: 
  - Desktop (>= 1024px width)
  - Tablet (~768px - 1023px width)
- **Method**: Repeat key E2E workflows (or spot-check critical UI sections like Toolbar, Grid, Well Detail layout, Chat Panel) on each browser/screen size combination using browser developer tools for resizing. Focus on layout breaks, element overlaps, and interactive element usability.

### 3. Performance Validation
- **Objective**: Check for acceptable load times and responsiveness.
- **Metrics**: 
  - Initial page load (Homescreen, Well Detail).
  - Real-time update latency (fault status, inventory log).
  - Subjective UI responsiveness.
- **Method**: Use browser developer tools (Network tab) to observe load times. Manually trigger real-time events and observe update speed. Interact with UI elements (filtering, sorting, chatting) to assess responsiveness.

### 4. Documentation Review
- **Objective**: Ensure the `README.md` is accurate, clear, and complete for setting up and running the project.
- **Areas to Check**: 
  - Setup steps (cloning, env vars, install, run).
  - Project description and features.
  - Technology stack.
- **Method**: Follow the setup instructions in the `README.md` from scratch (if possible) or review critically for clarity and correctness.

### 5. Code Review & Cleanup
- **Objective**: Perform a final pass over the codebase for quality and maintainability.
- **Areas to Check**: 
  - Consistency in coding style.
  - Clarity of component structure and logic.
  - Removal of commented-out code and unnecessary logs.
  - Correct handling of environment variables.
  - Final build check (`pnpm run build`).
- **Method**: Code inspection, focusing on recently modified files or areas known to be complex. Running the build command.

## Pass/Fail Criteria
- **E2E Workflows**: All core workflows complete without critical errors or unexpected behavior.
- **Cross-Browser/Responsiveness**: No major layout breaks or functionality issues on supported browsers/sizes.
- **Performance**: Load times and responsiveness are subjectively acceptable for a demo application.
- **Documentation**: `README.md` is clear, accurate, and sufficient to run the project.
- **Code Review**: No critical issues found; build completes successfully.
