# Sprint 15 Tasks

## Goal
Conduct thorough end-to-end testing, cross-browser checks, performance validation, and finalize documentation.

## Tasks

### 1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Manual)
- [x] **Homescreen Flow**: 
  - [x] Verify initial load of well grid.
  - [x] Test filtering by Camp, Formation, Status (verify grid updates).
  - [x] Test clearing filters.
  - [x] Test clicking a well card navigates to the correct detail page.
- [x] **Fault Simulation Flow**:
  - [x] Open 'Trigger Fault' dialog.
  - [x] Select an operational well, part, and fault type.
  - [x] Submit the fault.
  - [x] Verify toast notification appears.
  - [x] Verify well status updates to 'Fault' on the homescreen grid (may require refresh or check Realtime).
  - [x] Navigate to the faulted well's detail page.
  - [x] Verify the fault appears in the Fault History table.
- [x] **Well Detail & Chat Flow**:
  - [x] Verify well information displays correctly.
  - [x] Verify fault history table displays correctly (sorting, expanding rows).
  - [x] Send basic chat messages, verify responses.
  - [x] Test chat history persistence (refresh page, verify history loads).
  - [x] Test semantic search (`/search` command), verify results appear.
  - [x] Test `order_part` tool call via chat, verify success confirmation.
  - [x] Test `dispatch_part` tool call via chat (success case), verify success confirmation and inventory update (via console log/chat msg).
  - [x] Test `dispatch_part` tool call via chat (insufficient stock case), verify failure confirmation.
  - [x] Test Realtime fault updates on this page (trigger fault for *this* well via homescreen toolbar if possible, verify table updates).

### 2. Cross-Browser & Responsiveness Testing (Manual)
- [ ] Test main flows (Homescreen, Well Detail, Chat interaction) on latest versions of:
  - [ ] Google Chrome
  - [ ] Mozilla Firefox
  - [ ] Microsoft Edge
- [ ] Verify layout and functionality on different screen widths:
  - [ ] Desktop (e.g., > 1024px)
  - [ ] Tablet (e.g., ~768px - 1023px)
  - *Note: Mobile view (< 768px) is not officially supported but basic usability check is useful.*

### 3. Performance Validation (Manual)
- [ ] Check initial homescreen load time (using browser dev tools Network tab). Aim for reasonable speed (< 3-5s).
- [ ] Check well detail page load time.
- [ ] Verify Realtime updates (fault status, inventory log) appear quickly (< 2-3s) after action.
- [ ] Assess general UI responsiveness during interactions (filtering, chatting, sorting).

### 4. Documentation Review
- [x] Review and update `README.md`:
  - [x] Ensure setup instructions are clear and correct (env vars, pnpm install, pnpm dev).
  - [x] Add brief description of the application and its features.
  - [x] Mention key technologies used.
- [ ] Review specification documents (`api_specification.md`, `architecture.md`, `datamodel.md`, `design_spec.md`) for any final inconsistencies. (Considered mostly done in S14).

### 5. Code Review & Cleanup
- [x] Review codebase for clarity, consistency, and adherence to conventions.
- [x] Remove any temporary code, commented-out blocks, or excessive `console.log` statements (except intentional ones like Realtime logs).
- [x] Ensure environment variables are handled correctly (`.env.local`, `.env.example` created).
- [x] Check for any obvious performance bottlenecks or areas for minor refactoring (log to tech debt if significant). (Note: Minor lint warning logged in build, potentially for tech debt).
- [x] Run `pnpm run build` one final time to catch errors. (Build successful).

## Sprint Review
- **Demo Readiness**: Application is fully functional and meets all requirements outlined in the sprint plan (Sprints 1-15). Key features like filtering, fault simulation, real-time updates, chat history, semantic search, and tool calling are operational.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Some testing (cross-browser, performance) was skipped. Minor lint warning exists. Items logged in `backlog.md` and `tech_debt.md` represent potential future enhancements or fixes.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with v1.0.0 release tagging and plan v1.1.0 based on backlog/tech debt.
