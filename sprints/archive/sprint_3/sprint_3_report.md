# Sprint 3 Report

**Date:** 2024-05-16

**Sprint Goal:** Implement the main application layout, global styles, and core reusable UI components using Shadcn/UI.

**Summary:**
Sprint 3 focused on integrating the Shadcn/UI component library. The library was initialized using its CLI, basic components (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`) were added to the project structure, and the necessary Tailwind CSS theme configurations were verified. The project build remained successful after resolving a missing dependency (`tailwindcss-animate`).

**Completed Tasks:**

*   [x] Verify `app/layout.tsx` exists.
*   [x] Verify `app/globals.css` exists.
*   [x] Set up Shadcn/UI.
*   [x] Add initial Shadcn/UI components (`Button`, `Card`, `Badge`).
*   [x] Configure Tailwind CSS colors/theme for Shadcn/UI components.
