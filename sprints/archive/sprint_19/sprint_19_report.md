# Sprint 19 Report: Optional Backlog & Tech Debt

## Sprint Goal Summary

This sprint focused on addressing selected high-priority items from the backlog and technical debt logs. The primary goals were:
1.  Implement "Reset Demo" functionality.
2.  Improve Toolbar responsive layout.
3.  Address Real-time Updates Enhancement (TD-001).
4.  Add Fault Description Field (from Backlog).
5.  Implement Well Display View Toggle (from Backlog).

## Completed Work

All planned goals for Sprint 19 were successfully completed:

*   **Reset Demo:** A "Reset Demo" button was added to the toolbar, invoking a Supabase function (`reset_demo_data`) to reset relevant data (faults, inventory, well statuses, chat history). Functionality was tested and verified.
*   **Toolbar Responsiveness:** Analysis confirmed that the existing `flex-wrap` grouping in the toolbar provides acceptable wrapping behavior on smaller screens. No further changes were deemed necessary for this sprint.
*   **Real-time Updates (TD-001):** The issue of UI inconsistencies with real-time well status updates was resolved.
    *   Analysis identified missing real-time listeners in `WellGrid` and `WellTableView`, and potentially disabled table replication.
    *   Real-time listeners were added/updated in `WellGrid`, `WellTableView`, and `WellDetail`.
    *   The root cause was confirmed to be disabled Realtime replication for the `wells` table in Supabase, which was subsequently enabled.
    *   Testing confirmed that UI elements (status badges) now update automatically across card view, table view, and detail view when well statuses change.
*   **Fault Description:** The fault simulation modal and the corresponding API endpoint (`/api/faults`) were updated to include an optional description field. Tested successfully.
*   **View Toggle:** Buttons were added to the toolbar to toggle between Card view and Table view. The view state is managed via a URL search parameter (`?view=...`), and conditional rendering in `app/page.tsx` displays the appropriate component (`WellGrid` or `WellTableView`). Testing confirmed view switching works and filters are maintained.

## Sprint Review Notes

*   **Demo Readiness:** Key features implemented or fixed in this sprint are ready for demonstration, including Reset Demo, fault description, view toggle, and reliable real-time status updates.
*   **Gaps/Issues:** A minor known issue exists where real-time updates in the list views (`WellGrid`, `WellTableView`) don't currently re-apply filters. This is considered low priority.
*   **Next Steps:** Proceed with the next planned sprint or features as outlined in the project roadmap (`sprints/v1.1.0-sprintplan.md`). The real-time filter logic can be revisited later if needed.
