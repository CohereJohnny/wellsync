# Sprint 17 Report: MCP Server - Core Query Tools & Resources

## Goal Achieved
Implemented core MCP query tools (`get_wells`, `get_faults_by_well`, `get_part_inventory`) and exposed necessary data lists (`parts_list`, `fault_types_list`) as resources on the MCP server.

## Completed Tasks

- Implemented `get_wells` tool with optional filters for status, camp, and formation. Addressed issues related to type hints, case sensitivity, and "all" filter handling.
- Implemented `get_faults_by_well` tool to retrieve fault history for a specific well.
- Implemented `get_part_inventory` tool to check stock for a specific part.
- Exposed the list of all parts as the `parts_list` MCP resource, including simple caching.
- Exposed the predefined list of fault types as the `fault_types_list` MCP resource.
- Ensured clear schemas were defined for tools and resources via decorators and function signatures, resolving initial `TypeError` issues related to decorator arguments.
- Performed basic validation of tool functionality using the Cohere UI.

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: Core query tools and resource lists are implemented and functional on the MCP server, enabling basic data retrieval via an LLM.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Initial implementation required debugging related to MCP decorator syntax (`parameters`, `uri`) and Python type hints (`str | None`). Case sensitivity in database filters was also addressed. Workflow tools (`chat_with_well`, `order_part`, `dispatch_part`) are still pending.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 18 to implement the workflow tools via API integration with the Next.js application.
