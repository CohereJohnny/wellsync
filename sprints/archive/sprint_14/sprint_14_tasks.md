# Sprint 14 Tasks

## Goal
Implement real-time updates for inventory changes and apply final UI polish based on the design spec.

## Tasks

### 1. Real-time Inventory Integration
- [x] Set up Supabase Realtime subscription for the `inventory` table.
  - *Progress*: Identified `ChatPanel.tsx` as the location for the subscription.
  - *Progress*: Implemented the subscription logic using the Supabase client library in a `useEffect` hook.
- [x] Define and implement UI feedback for inventory changes.
  - *Progress*: Confirmed existing assistant confirmation message provides primary feedback (new stock level).
  - *Progress*: Implemented console logging (`console.log`) within the Realtime subscription callback for secondary verification.

### 2. UI Polish & Refinement (General)
- [x] Review `design_spec.md` for UI guidelines. (Action: Need to locate and potentially read this file).
  - *Progress*: Reviewed spec file.
- [x] Apply consistent styling (spacing, typography, colors) across all major views:
  - [x] Homescreen (`WellGrid`, `WellCard`, Toolbar)
  - [x] Well Detail (`WellDetail`, `FaultHistoryTable`)
  - [x] Chat Panel (`ChatPanel`)
- [x] Add hover effects to interactive elements (buttons, cards, table rows, etc.).
  - *Progress*: Applied basic hover effects, further refinement possible.
- [x] Implement subtle transitions/animations for loading states or view changes if appropriate.
  - *Progress*: Basic transitions applied (e.g., `transition-transform` on card hover). More can be added later.
- [x] Verify responsiveness and visual consistency on desktop and tablet-like screen sizes.
  - *Progress*: Addressed Toolbar overflow issue by logging backlog item. Basic responsiveness checked.

### 3. Component Consistency
- [x] Review usage of Shadcn/UI components for consistency.
- [x] Refactor or restyle any custom components to align with the overall design.
  - *Progress*: Reviewed major components, styling aligned where updated.

### 4. Testing & Verification
- [x] Test real-time inventory updates: Trigger a dispatch via chat and verify the update mechanism works as expected.
  - *Progress*: Verified console log appears in `ChatPanel` upon successful dispatch and inventory update.
- [x] Manually review all polished UI elements across different views and states.
  - *Progress*: User visually reviewed and approved current state.

## Sprint Review
- **Demo Readiness**: The application now includes real-time inventory updates (verified via console logs) triggered by the dispatch workflow. Core UI elements (cards, toolbar, tables, chat) have been styled based on the Cohere Toolkit theme and `design_spec.md`, improving visual consistency. Basic hover effects and transitions are implemented.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Further UI polish (advanced animations, detailed component states) could be added. The mobile responsiveness of the toolbar needs addressing (logged in backlog). Dark mode theme was not updated. Font files for `CohereText/Variable/Mono` are not integrated.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 15 (Testing & Final Review). Address backlog items (Toolbar responsiveness, Reset Demo) in future sprints if prioritized.
