# Sprint 21 Report: Internationalization Implementation

## Sprint Overview
Sprint 21 focused on implementing internationalization (i18n) in the WellSync AI application to support multiple languages. The goal was to ensure all UI text could be translated and to provide a simple way for users to switch between languages.

## Accomplishments

### Core Implementation
- Successfully implemented i18n using react-i18next and next-intl libraries
- Created comprehensive translation files for four languages:
  - English (en)
  - Spanish (es)
  - Vietnamese (vi)
  - Portuguese (pt)
- Configured the application to detect and switch languages based on URL path segments

### UI Components
- Developed a dropdown-based language switcher component that matches the blue toolbar design
- Displayed language names in their native form (English, Español, Tiếng Việt, Português)
- Fixed issue with snake_case to camelCase conversion in translation keys for fault types
- Ensured all text elements across the application use translation keys

### Technical Challenges Overcome
- Addressed build issues related to missing tr46 module dependency
- Resolved initial implementation hurdles that occurred in the first attempt at internationalization
- Ensured proper loading of locale files and fallback behavior for missing translations

## Challenges & Lessons Learned
- The initial attempt using only next-intl encountered build errors, leading to a pivot to a hybrid approach with react-i18next
- Managing translation keys in nested JSON structures required careful organization to avoid missing translations
- Supporting multiple languages with different character sets reinforced the importance of responsive design and flexible layouts

## Testing Results
All test cases passed successfully, confirming that:
- All four languages display correctly throughout the application
- Language switching works via both URL changes and the dropdown menu
- Build process completes without errors
- UI layout properly accommodates different text lengths in various languages

## Next Steps & Recommendations
- Consider adding more languages in the future as needed
- Review and update translations periodically, especially for technical terms
- Monitor for any performance impact as the application's feature set grows

## Conclusion
Sprint 21 successfully delivered a fully functional internationalization system for the WellSync AI application, allowing users to interact with the platform in their preferred language. The implementation is robust, maintainable, and can be easily extended to support additional languages in the future.
