# Sprint 9 Report

## Sprint Goal
Implement the GenAI chat panel UI and connect it to Cohere Command A for basic conversational responses.

## Completed Tasks

### Chat Panel UI Components
- Created `ChatPanel.tsx` component and integrated it into `WellDetail`.
- Implemented message list container using `ScrollArea` with auto-scroll.
- Created message input field and send button with `handleSubmit` logic.
- Added loading state indicators during API calls.
- Styled chat bubbles for user and assistant messages, including refinements from BUG-013.

### Chat State Management
- Set up Zustand store (`chat-store.ts`) with persistence for chat state.
- Defined `Message` interface in the store.
- Implemented message list state management (`addMessage`, per-well retrieval).
- Added loading state management (`isLoading`, `setLoading`).
- Created actions for adding/updating messages (`addMessage`, `setLoading`, `setError`, `clearMessages`).

### NextJS API Route Setup
- Created `/api/chat` route handler (`route.ts`) which is functional.
- Confirmed environment variables (`COHERE_API_KEY`) are set.
- Implemented basic request validation for `messages` and `wellId`.
- Added error handling middleware (`try...catch`) with detailed logging.
- Set up proper response typing using `NextResponse.json`.

### Cohere Integration
- Installed and configured Cohere V2 SDK (`lib/cohere.ts`).
- Set up Command A model configuration in the API route call.
- Implemented basic chat completion using `cohere.chat` with history and context.
- Added basic handling for Cohere response text.

### Message Handling
- Implemented message sending logic in `ChatPanel`'s `handleSubmit`.
- Created message formatting utilities for context and chat history in the API route.
- Handled different message types by mapping roles ('user'/'assistant' to 'User'/'Chatbot' - BUG-011).
- Implemented improved error messages via API response handling and toast notifications.

### UI Polish
- Implemented auto-scroll behavior using `useEffect` and `scrollToBottom`.
- Added smooth fade-in animations for new messages.
- Added typing indicators (covered by loading state animation).
- Styled scrollbars using `tailwind-scrollbar`.
- Added hover states and transitions (marked complete, may need verification).

## Bug Fixes During Sprint
- **BUG-010**: Fixed incorrect column name (`created_at` vs `timestamp`) for fault timestamps in the chat API.
- **BUG-011**: Resolved Cohere API errors by correctly mapping message roles ('user'/'assistant' to 'User'/'Chatbot').
- **BUG-012**: Fixed an issue where messages weren't displaying correctly in the UI due to incorrect array handling in the API request.
- **BUG-013**: Corrected chat message text wrapping and improved bubble layout/styling.
- **BUG-014**: Resolved `ChunkLoadError` by clearing the Next.js cache and fixing layout issues.
- **BUG-015**: Fixed chat module loading errors (`tr46`) and viewport metadata warnings by cleaning dependencies and updating layout.
- **BUG-016**: Resolved a TypeError in the chat API route caused by sending an empty message array on the first interaction.

## Incomplete Tasks
- **Chat Panel UI Components**: Ensure responsive design for all screen sizes.
- **Cohere Integration**: Handle rate limiting and advanced errors.
- **Message Handling**: Add retry mechanism for failed requests.
- **Testing**: All testing tasks remain (Unit tests, API integration, Error handling, Responsiveness, Accessibility).
- **Documentation**: All documentation tasks remain.

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: The core chat functionality is operational. Users can converse with the AI, leveraging well context and fault history, with persistent conversations.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Advanced error handling, full responsiveness, testing, and documentation are outstanding. Some minor UI polish (hover states) needs verification/completion.
- **Next Steps**: Prioritize testing, documentation, responsiveness, and advanced error handling in subsequent sprints or refinement phases.
