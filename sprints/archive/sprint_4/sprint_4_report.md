# Sprint 4 Report

**Date:** 2024-05-16

**Sprint Goal:** Display the 5x6 grid of well cards on the homescreen, fetching data from Supabase.

**Summary:**
Sprint 4 successfully implemented the foundational components for the homescreen well grid. The Supabase client was configured, a `Well` type defined, and the `WellCard` and `WellGrid` components were created. Data fetching logic was implemented within `WellGrid` to retrieve well information from the Supabase `wells` table, and the grid was integrated into the main application page (`app/page.tsx`). The project builds successfully. Currently, the grid displays a "No wells found" message as mock data has not yet been loaded.

**Completed Tasks:**

*   [x] Create `lib/supabase.ts` for Supabase client initialization.
*   [x] Define `Well` type/interface in `lib/types.ts`.
*   [x] Create `components/WellCard.tsx` component.
*   [x] Create `components/WellGrid.tsx` component.
*   [x] Implement data fetching logic in `WellGrid.tsx` using Supabase client (`GET /wells`).
*   [x] Integrate `WellGrid.tsx` into `app/page.tsx`.

**Notes from `sprint_4_tasks.md`:**
*   This sprint focuses on displaying the core data on the homescreen.
*   Mock data is not yet loaded; fetching will initially return an empty list.

**Sprint Review Notes:**
*   **(User to add notes from sprint_4_tasks.md here)**
    *   *Example:* Demo Readiness: Homescreen grid structure implemented (`WellGrid`, `WellCard`). Data fetching from Supabase `wells` table is working (currently returns empty). Project builds successfully.
    *   *Example:* Gaps/Issues: None. Fetching returns empty list as expected due to no mock data yet.
    *   *Example:* Next Steps: Ready for Sprint 5 (Homescreen Filtering & Toolbar).
