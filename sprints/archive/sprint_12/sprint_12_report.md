# Sprint 12 Report

## Sprint Goal
Integrate semantic search functionality into the chat panel, using Cohere Rerank for relevance.

## Completed Tasks

### API Route (`/api/search_faults`)
- Created the Next.js API route handler (`app/api/search_faults/route.ts`).
- Implemented request body validation for `query` and `wellId`.
- Added basic error handling (`try...catch`).
- Initialized Supabase and Cohere clients.

### Embedding & Initial Search Logic
- Integrated Cohere Embed API (`embed-english-v3.0`, `input_type: search_query`) to generate query embeddings.
- Integrated Supabase RPC call to `search_faults` function, passing the query embedding, a similarity threshold (0.5), and match count (30).
- Added specific error handling for embed and RPC calls.

### Rerank Integration
- Formatted initial RPC results into text documents suitable for Cohere Rerank.
- Integrated Cohere Rerank API (`rerank-english-v2.0`) call with the query and formatted documents.
- Set `topN` parameter to 5.
- Mapped reranked results back to original fault data, adding the `rerank_score`.
- Added error handling for the rerank step, falling back to initial results.

### API Response
- Structured the final API response to return the reranked list of faults.
- Ensured consistent JSON responses using `NextResponse.json`.

### Frontend Integration (`ChatPanel.tsx`)
- Implemented two search trigger mechanisms:
    - Keyword trigger (`/search ...`) in the input field.
    - Dedicated "Search" icon button.
- Added `isSearching` state and a loading indicator specific to search operations.
- Implemented `handleSearch` function to call the `/api/search_faults` endpoint.
- Displayed search results as a summarized assistant message in the chat panel.

### Testing
- Manually tested API endpoint (`/api/search_faults`) using `curl` for:
    - Valid requests (returning expected reranked results).
    - Invalid requests (missing query/wellId, returning 400 errors).
    - Irrelevant queries (returning empty results).
- Manually tested frontend integration:
    - Verified both keyword and button triggers initiate search.
    - Confirmed loading indicator display.
    - Confirmed successful results summary display.
    - Confirmed empty results display.
    - Confirmed error handling display (via toast) by simulating a 404 error.
- Deferred specific API error condition tests (Cohere API failure, RPC function failure) to Tech Debt (TD-003).

### Documentation
- Created API documentation file (`docs/api_search_faults.md`).
- Documented the text formatting for Rerank within the API docs.
- Added inline comments to `ChatPanel.tsx` explaining search-related functionality.

## Incomplete Tasks / Deferred Items
- Specific API error handling tests (Cohere/RPC failures) deferred (TD-003).
- Frontend result display is currently a basic text summary; could be enhanced (e.g., cards).
- No automated tests were added.

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: Semantic fault search is integrated into the chat panel. Users can search via command or button, results are processed using Embed and Rerank, and a summary is displayed.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Deferred specific error tests. Basic result display. No automated tests.
- **Next Steps**: Enhance result display, address tech debt tests, or proceed with next features.
