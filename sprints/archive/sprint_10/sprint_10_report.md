# Sprint 10 Report

## Sprint Goal
Enable context awareness in the chat by storing and retrieving conversation history.

## Completed Tasks

### Database & Schema
- Defined `chat_history` table schema (id, well_id, messages JSONB, updated_at).
- Created Supabase migration SQL script (`001_create_chat_history_table.sql`).
- Added a unique constraint to `well_id` (`002_add_unique_constraint_chat_history_well_id.sql`) after clearing duplicates.

### API Routes
- Implemented `GET /api/chat_history` endpoint to fetch message history for a well.
- Implemented `POST /api/chat_history` endpoint to append/update history (though primarily handled via `POST /api/chat`).
- Added basic validation and error handling in `chat_history` routes.

### Chat Integration
- Updated `POST /api/chat` route to fetch existing chat history from the database.
- Passed combined historical and new messages to the Cohere API.
- Updated `POST /api/chat` to `upsert` the complete conversation history (including assistant's response) back into the `chat_history` table, using `well_id` as the conflict target.
- Ensured correct message ordering during history updates.

### Frontend Updates
- Modified `ChatPanel` to load chat history from `/api/chat_history` on component mount using `useEffect`.
- Utilized the `setMessages` action from the Zustand store to populate history.
- Ensured history is displayed on initial render.
- Added `Skeleton` components to indicate history loading state.
- Confirmed backend handles history management, simplifying frontend logic (no need to send full history from client).

### Markdown Support
- Installed the `react-markdown` package.
- Updated chat bubbles in `ChatPanel` to render message content using `<ReactMarkdown>`.
- Ensured basic Markdown elements (paragraphs, lists, etc.) render correctly.

### UI & UX
- Implemented skeleton loaders for the history loading state.
- Ensured auto-scroll behavior functions correctly after history loads.
- Added a message to indicate when a well has no prior conversation history.

## Bug Fixes During Sprint
- Resolved database errors related to `.single()` expecting one row when duplicates existed.
- Fixed `upsert` logic to use `onConflict: 'well_id'` to prevent creating duplicate history records.
- Corrected linter errors related to Cohere SDK types (`Message`) and response properties (`.text` vs `.content`).
- Addressed Cohere API errors regarding message content requirements by filtering messages.

## Incomplete Tasks
- **Testing**: All testing tasks deferred (Unit tests for API, integration tests for `ChatPanel`, Markdown validation).
- **Documentation**: All documentation tasks deferred (DB schema, API docs, JSDoc).

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: Chat history persistence per well is fully functional. Conversations load from the database, are sent to the AI with context, saved back, and support basic Markdown rendering.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Formal testing and documentation were deferred. Advanced Markdown styling (syntax highlighting) is not implemented.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed with Sprint 11 (Semantic Search). Address deferred tasks later.
