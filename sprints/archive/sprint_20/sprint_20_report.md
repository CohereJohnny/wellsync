# Sprint 20 Report

## Sprint Goal Summary

The primary goals of Sprint 20 were to refactor the main table views (`WellTableView`, `FaultHistoryTable`) to use TanStack Table (v8), implement a site-wide navigation toolbar, and address various UI/UX bugs and improvements identified in previous sprints or during development. The target release for these changes is v1.1.2.

## Completed Tasks

Based on `sprint_20_tasks.md`, the following key tasks were completed:

*   **TanStack Table Refactor:**
    *   Successfully installed dependencies.
    *   Refactored `well-table-view.tsx` and `fault-history-table.tsx` to use TanStack Table for core structure, data handling, sorting, and row expansion (where applicable).
    *   Integrated existing features like filtering (via URL params), link rendering, status badges, loading/error states, and real-time updates within the new table structure.
*   **Navigation & Layout:**
    *   Defined the `Main Navigation Toolbar` component in the `design_spec.md`.
    *   Created and styled the `MainToolbar` component (`components/layout/main-toolbar.tsx`) with links, title, and icon.
    *   Integrated the `MainToolbar` into the root layout (`app/layout.tsx`).
    *   Removed the redundant `<h1>` dashboard title from the homepage (`app/page.tsx`).
*   **Bug Fixes & Improvements:**
    *   Resolved the issue where new faults didn't appear immediately in the `WellDetail` view after navigation by disabling caching (`revalidate = 0`) on the page route.
    *   Adjusted padding in the `ChatPanel` for better visual spacing.
    *   Investigated the API error (`Unexpected end of JSON input`) for `order_part`/`dispatch_part` tool calls. Added logging confirmed the issue is likely related to empty parameters being sent from Cohere, despite being marked required.
*   **Build & Testing:**
    *   Resolved several build errors related to component prop mismatches (`FaultSimulationForm`, `FaultSimulationModalContent`, `WellTableView` type matching).
    *   Performed basic functional testing on refactored tables, toolbar, and bug fixes.

## Sprint Review Notes

*   **Demo Readiness**: High. The core application views (dashboard, well detail) are functional with improved table components and consistent navigation. Key bugs impacting user experience have been addressed.
*   **Gaps/Issues**: 
    *   The primary outstanding issue is the API error for `order_part`/`dispatch_part` tool calls due to potentially empty parameters from the LLM. This blocks crucial workflow functionality.
    *   The pages linked from the main toolbar (Inventory, Settings, Documentation) are currently non-existent and will result in 404s.
*   **Next Steps**: 
    *   Prioritize resolving the tool call API error in the next sprint.
    *   Create basic placeholder pages for the new navigation links.

## Release Target

This work contributes to the planned **v1.1.2** release.
