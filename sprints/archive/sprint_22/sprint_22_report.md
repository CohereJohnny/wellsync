# Sprint 22 Report

## Goals Achieved
- Researched and implemented a documentation feature for the application.
- Made existing markdown documentation accessible to end users via the UI.

## Completed Tasks

### Research and Planning
- Researched MDX and markdown rendering options for Next.js.
- Explored design patterns for documentation UI in similar applications.
- Defined the documentation site structure and navigation.

### Core Documentation Setup
- Installed required dependencies (@next/mdx, related packages, and Tailwind Typography).
- Configured Next.js to support MDX files.
- Created mdx-components.tsx in project root.
- Implemented basic documentation page layout.

### Documentation UI Components
- Created DocumentationLayout with floating left navigation.
- Implemented Table of Contents component for doc pages.
- Developed enhanced code block component with syntax highlighting, line numbers and copy button.
- Implemented (but later removed) search functionality for documentation content.

### Documentation Routes and Content Loading
- Set up documentation home page.
- Implemented dynamic routes for documentation pages.
- Created utility for loading and processing markdown files.
- Connected existing docs folder content to the new documentation system.

### Documentation Features
- Added dark/light mode support for documentation pages (defaulting to light).
- Implemented responsive design for mobile viewing.
- Implemented (but later removed) "Edit this page" functionality.
- Created next/previous page navigation.

### Testing and Refinement
- Tested documentation rendering with various markdown content.
- Ensured responsive design works across device sizes.
- Tested navigation functionality.
- Verified proper syntax highlighting for code blocks.

### Release Preparation
- Updated main-toolbar.tsx to link properly to new documentation.
- Ensured all translations work correctly for documentation UI.

## Sprint Review Notes
- **Demo Readiness**: The core documentation feature is implemented and functional, including navigation, markdown rendering, TOC, dark mode support, internationalized UI, and enhanced code blocks. The application builds successfully.
- **Gaps/Issues**: The styling for the custom code block component needs further refinement to exactly match the target look (border/background issue persists despite attempts).
- **Next Steps**: Address code block styling in a future sprint. Proceed with final testing and release preparation for 1.1.3.

## Uncompleted Tasks
- Prepare for version 1.1.3 release.
- Final review and testing.
