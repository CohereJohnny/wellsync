# Sprint 22 Updates

## Context
Sprint 22 focuses on implementing a documentation feature for the WellSync application. The goal is to display the existing markdown documentation in the docs folder to end users in an accessible, well-designed UI within the application.

## Progress Updates

### [Date: Initial Setup]

### [Date: Documentation System Implementation]

- Implemented DocumentationLayout with responsive sidebar navigation
- Created documentation homepage with categorized card layout
- Implemented dynamic routing for individual documentation pages
- Set up markdown parsing and rendering with react-markdown

## Design Decisions
