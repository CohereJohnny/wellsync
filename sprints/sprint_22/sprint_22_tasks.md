## Sprint Review
- **Demo Readiness**: The core documentation feature is implemented and functional, including navigation, markdown rendering, TOC, dark mode support, internationalized UI, and enhanced code blocks. The application builds successfully.
- **Gaps/Issues**: The styling for the custom code block component needs further refinement to exactly match the target look (border/background issue persists despite attempts).
- [ ] Next Steps: Address code block styling in a future sprint. Proceed with final testing and release preparation for 1.1.3.
