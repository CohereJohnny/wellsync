# Sprint 14 Report

*This file will be populated at the end of Sprint 14 with a summary based on `sprint_14_tasks.md`.*

## Sprint Goal
Implement real-time updates for inventory changes and apply final UI polish based on the design spec.

## Completed Tasks
- Set up Supabase Realtime subscription for the `inventory` table in `ChatPanel.tsx`.
- Implemented console logging for inventory change events.
- Reviewed `design_spec.md` and applied styling (colors, typography, spacing) inspired by Cohere Toolkit to Homescreen, Well Detail, and Chat Panel views.
- Applied basic hover effects and transitions.
- Performed basic responsiveness checks and logged toolbar overflow issue to backlog.
- Reviewed component consistency.
- Tested and verified real-time inventory updates via console logs.
- Visually reviewed and approved UI polish state with user.

## Incomplete Tasks / Deferred Items
- Advanced UI polish (animations, detailed states).
- Dark mode theme update.
- Integration of Cohere font files (`CohereText`, `CohereVariable`, `CohereMono`).

## Sprint Review Summary
- **Demo Readiness**: The application now includes real-time inventory updates (verified via console logs) triggered by the dispatch workflow. Core UI elements (cards, toolbar, tables, chat) have been styled based on the Cohere Toolkit theme and `design_spec.md`, improving visual consistency. Basic hover effects and transitions are implemented.
- **Gaps/Issues**: Further UI polish (advanced animations, detailed component states) could be added. The mobile responsiveness of the toolbar needs addressing (logged in backlog). Dark mode theme was not updated. Font files for `CohereText/Variable/Mono` are not integrated.
- **Next Steps**: Proceed to Sprint 15 (Testing & Final Review). Address backlog items (Toolbar responsiveness, Reset Demo) in future sprints if prioritized.
