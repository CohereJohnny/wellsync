# Sprint 14 Test Plan

## Goal
Verify the implementation of real-time inventory updates and the application of UI polish across the WellSync AI demo application.

## Test Cases

### TC1: Real-time Inventory Update Verification
- **Objective**: Ensure that inventory changes triggered by the dispatch workflow are received via Realtime subscription and reflected appropriately in the UI.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to the Well Detail page for any well.
  2. Open the Chat Panel.
  3. *Optional*: Query the assistant for the current stock level of a specific part (e.g., "What is the stock level for part P001 at warehouse W01?") or assume a known starting state.
  4. Initiate a dispatch action via chat that should succeed (e.g., "Dispatch 1 unit of P001 from W01 to this well").
  5. Observe the assistant's confirmation message and any other UI feedback related to the inventory update.
  6. *Optional*: Query the assistant again for the stock level to confirm the change.
- **Expected Result**: 
  - The dispatch simulation should succeed (assuming sufficient stock).
  - The Realtime subscription should receive the inventory update event.
  - The UI should provide feedback reflecting the successful dispatch and the inventory change (e.g., the assistant's confirmation message should mention the new stock level, or a console log should appear if that's the chosen feedback method).

### TC2: UI Polish Verification - Homescreen
- **Objective**: Verify that the UI elements on the homescreen (Grid, Cards, Toolbar) have been polished according to the design specification.
- **Steps**:
  1. Load the application homescreen.
  2. Visually inspect the `WellGrid` layout, spacing, and alignment.
  3. Visually inspect individual `WellCard` components for correct data display, status indicator appearance, typography, padding, and border styles.
  4. Visually inspect the Toolbar for correct layout, component styling (buttons, dropdowns), and typography.
  5. Hover over interactive elements (Well Cards, Toolbar buttons, filter dropdowns) and verify appropriate hover styles are applied.
  6. Resize the browser window to simulate different desktop/tablet widths and check for responsiveness and layout consistency.
- **Expected Result**: The homescreen UI elements appear visually polished, adhere to the design spec (if available), maintain consistency, and respond correctly to different screen sizes and interactions (hover).

### TC3: UI Polish Verification - Well Detail View
- **Objective**: Verify that the UI elements on the Well Detail view have been polished.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate to any Well Detail page.
  2. Visually inspect the overall split-screen layout.
  3. Inspect the well information section for correct styling, typography, and spacing.
  4. Inspect the `FaultHistoryTable` for correct styling, header appearance, row spacing, and typography.
  5. Hover over table rows or any other interactive elements and verify appropriate hover styles.
  6. Resize the browser window and check for responsiveness.
- **Expected Result**: The Well Detail view appears visually polished, consistent, and responsive, with appropriate hover states.

### TC4: UI Polish Verification - Chat Panel
- **Objective**: Verify that the UI elements within the Chat Panel have been polished.
- **Steps**:
  1. Open the Chat Panel on a Well Detail page.
  2. Visually inspect the message list, user/assistant message bubble styling, markdown rendering, timestamps, scrollbar appearance.
  3. Inspect the chat input area, send button styling, and disabled states.
  4. Verify loading indicators (e.g., during assistant response generation) are styled appropriately.
  5. Hover over the send button and any other interactive elements.
  6. Send a few messages to observe the chat flow and appearance.
- **Expected Result**: The Chat Panel UI is visually polished, consistent, handles different states (loading, disabled) gracefully, and applies appropriate hover effects.

### TC5: Component Consistency Review
- **Objective**: Ensure consistent usage and styling of common UI components (Shadcn/UI and custom) across the application.
- **Steps**:
  1. Navigate through all main views (Homescreen, Well Detail).
  2. Identify common components (Buttons, Cards, Badges, Tables, Dropdowns, Inputs).
  3. Verify that variants (e.g., primary/secondary buttons) are used consistently.
  4. Check for consistent typography, spacing, and color usage within components.
  5. Compare against `design_spec.md` or established style guidelines.
- **Expected Result**: UI components exhibit consistent visual styling and are used appropriately throughout the application, adhering to the defined design language.
