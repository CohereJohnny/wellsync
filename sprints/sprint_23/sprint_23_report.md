# Sprint 23 Report

## Goals Achieved
- Added a "Map View" toggle to the Dashboard Toolbar.
- Implemented the core `MapViewDashboard` component, displaying wells from Supabase on an interactive Mapbox map.
- Included a scrollable sidebar listing wells alongside the map.
- Enabled conditional rendering of Card, Table, and Map views on the Dashboard based on the selected toggle.
- Centralized the "Simulate Fault" dialog logic, making it accessible consistently from the Toolbar, Map View list context menu, Table View actions column, and Well Card context menu.

## Completed Tasks
- Branch setup and file initialization.
- Toolbar modifications for Map View toggle and state management via URL params.
- Creation and core implementation of `MapViewDashboard`.
- Integration of Mapbox GL JS for map display and markers.
- Fetching and display of well data (including status-based markers).
- Creation and styling of `MapWellListItem` for the sidebar.
- Implementation of the scrollable sidebar in `MapViewDashboard`.
- Integration of `MapViewDashboard` into the main dashboard page (`app/[locale]/page.tsx`).
- Handling of interactions between the map list and map markers (zoom).
- Refactoring of the "Simulate Fault" functionality into a reusable `FaultSimulationDialog` component and wiring it up to Toolbar, MapView, TableView, and WellCard.
- Fixed various build and runtime errors related to component props and module resolution.

## Incomplete Tasks / Issues
- "Create Service Request" action is not implemented (shows placeholder toast).
- Minor styling refinements for the Map View could be considered.
- Persistent linter errors for `geist/font` and `site-footer` in `app/[locale]/layout.tsx` require further investigation.

## Sprint Review Notes
- **Demo Readiness:** Core Map View, view toggling, and the centralized Fault Simulation dialog are functional.
- **Gaps/Issues:** Unimplemented "Create SR" action, potential styling tweaks, unresolved linter errors in layout file.
- **Next Steps:** Address incomplete items in future sprints/backlog, investigate linter errors.
