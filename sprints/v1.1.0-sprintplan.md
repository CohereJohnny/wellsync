# WellSync AI - v1.1.0 Sprint Plan

This document outlines the planned sprints for the WellSync AI v1.1.0 release, following the process in `sprintmanagement.mdc`.

## Goals for v1.1.0:

1.  **MCP Server Implementation:** Expose WellSync functionality (queries, chat, workflows) as tools via a Python AuthorizedMCP server.
2.  **(Optional/Stretch)** Address key items from `backlog.md` and `tech_debt.md` (e.g., Reset Demo, Toolbar Responsiveness, Real-time enhancements, ESLint warning).

## Sprint 16: MCP Server - Python Environment Setup
- **Goal**: Prepare the Python development environment within the `/mcp` directory for the MCP server.
- **Key Tasks**:
    - Create Python virtual environment (e.g., `.venv`) in `/mcp`.
    - Install necessary base dependencies (`supabase-py`, `python-dotenv`, `requests`/`httpx`).
    - Install MCP SDK dependencies (`pip install mcp`, `pip install git+https://github.com/abdullahkady/python-sdk.git` for AuthorizedMCP).
    - Configure `.env` file loading for Supabase/other credentials within `/mcp`.
    - Set up `.gitignore` for Python environment files.
    - Basic validation of environment and Supabase client connection within `/mcp`.

## Sprint 17: MCP Server - Core Query Tools & Resources
- **Goal**: Implement MCP tools for querying data and expose static lists as resources.
- **Key Tasks**:
    - Implement `get_wells_by_status` tool (filters: status, potentially camp/formation).
    - Implement `get_faults_by_well` tool.
    - Implement `get_part_inventory` tool (check stock for a specific part).
    - Expose `Parts` list as an MCP Resource.
    - Expose `Fault Types` list as an MCP Resource.
    - Define clear schemas (parameters, descriptions) for tools and resources.

## Sprint 18: MCP Server - Workflow Tools via API Integration
- **Goal**: Implement MCP tools that interact with the existing Next.js API endpoints.
- **Key Tasks**:
    - Implement `chat_with_well` tool (calls `/api/chat`).
    - Implement `order_part` tool (calls `/api/orders`).
    - Implement `dispatch_part` tool (calls `/api/dispatches`).
    - Handle authentication/secrets if needed for API calls.
    - Ensure proper error handling and result formatting.

## Sprint 19 (Optional): Backlog & Tech Debt
- **Goal**: Address selected high-priority items from `backlog.md` and `tech_debt.md`.
- **Key Tasks**:
    - Implement "Reset Demo" functionality.
    - Improve Toolbar responsive layout.
    - Address Real-time Updates Enhancement (TD-001).
    - Address ESLint warning from build.
