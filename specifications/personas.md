# Personas - Oil & Gas GenAI Demo

## 1. Introduction
This document defines the primary persona for the Oil & Gas Generative AI Demo application. The persona represents the key user interacting with the demo, ensuring the application is tailored to their needs, goals, and challenges. The primary persona is a Production Supervisor, responsible for overseeing oil well operations in the Permian Basin.

## 2. Primary Persona: Production Supervisor

### 2.1 Persona Details
- **Name**: Alex Carter
- **Age**: 38
- **Location**: Midland, Texas
- **Education**: Bachelor’s Degree in Petroleum Engineering
- **Experience**: 12 years in oilfield operations, 5 years as a Production Supervisor
- **Technical Proficiency**: Comfortable with web-based dashboards and mobile apps; basic understanding of AI tools but not an expert
- **Work Environment**: Office-based with frequent field visits; uses desktop and tablet devices

### 2.2 Role and Responsibilities
- Oversees daily operations of 25-30 oil wells across multiple camps (e.g., Midland, Delaware) and formations (e.g., Spraberry, Wolfcamp).
- Monitors well performance and equipment status to ensure production targets are met.
- Responds to equipment faults, coordinates maintenance, and manages parts inventory.
- Communicates with field technicians, warehouse managers, and manufacturers to resolve issues.
- Reports production metrics and incident summaries to senior management.

### 2.3 Goals
- Quickly identify and address equipment faults to minimize downtime.
- Ensure replacement parts are sourced efficiently to maintain operations.
- Access clear, actionable information about well status and inventory without complex processes.
- Demonstrate to stakeholders how AI can streamline fault resolution and inventory management.
- Maintain high operational efficiency across all wells under supervision.

### 2.4 Pain Points
- Delays in identifying faulty equipment due to manual monitoring processes.
- Difficulty tracking part availability across multiple warehouses.
- Time-consuming communication with vendors for part orders or dispatch.
- Overwhelmed by scattered data sources for well performance and fault details.
- Pressure to reduce downtime while managing a large number of wells.

### 2.5 Interaction with the Demo
- **Homescreen**:
  - Views the grid of 25-30 well cards to monitor operational status.
  - Uses the toolbar to simulate faults for demo purposes, observing real-time status updates (green to red).
  - Filters wells by camp, formation, or status to focus on specific areas.
- **Well Detail View**:
  - Clicks a well card to access detailed information (e.g., fault details, last maintenance).
  - Reviews fault specifics (e.g., affected part, fault type) to assess urgency.
- **GenAI Assistant**:
  - Engages in conversational queries (e.g., “What’s wrong with Well-12?” or “Is a replacement pump available?”).
  - Relies on the assistant to retrieve real-time data about well status, part details, and inventory.
  - Initiates workflows via chat, such as ordering a part from the manufacturer or dispatching a part from the nearest warehouse.
- **Fault Simulation**:
  - Triggers faults to test the system’s response and evaluate AI-driven recommendations.
  - Observes notifications and status updates to ensure timely awareness.
- **Workflows**:
  - Uses the assistant to streamline part ordering or dispatching, reducing manual coordination.
  - Expects clear confirmation of actions (e.g., “Part dispatched from Warehouse W01”).

### 2.6 Needs from the Demo
- **Intuitive Interface**: Simple navigation to monitor wells and access fault details.
- **Real-time Updates**: Immediate visibility of fault triggers and status changes.
- **Actionable AI Insights**: Clear, concise assistant responses with relevant data and workflow options.
- **Efficiency**: Fast access to inventory data and automated workflows to reduce response time.
- **Demo Flexibility**: Ability to simulate various fault scenarios to showcase AI capabilities to stakeholders.

### 2.7 Success Criteria
- Can trigger and resolve at least 5 fault scenarios in under 10 minutes.
- Successfully uses the assistant to order or dispatch parts for 3 different wells.
- Finds the interface intuitive and the assistant’s responses accurate and helpful.
- Feels confident presenting the demo to stakeholders as a proof-of-concept for AI in oilfield operations.

## 3. Future Persona Considerations
- **Secondary Personas** (to be defined in later iterations):
  - Field Technician: Executes maintenance tasks based on supervisor’s instructions.
  - Operations Manager: Reviews high-level production metrics and AI-driven insights.
  - Inventory Manager: Oversees warehouse stock and part logistics.
- These personas may interact with the demo in limited capacities (e.g., viewing reports or receiving dispatch notifications) but are not the primary focus.
