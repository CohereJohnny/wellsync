# WellSync AI - v1.0.0 Release Notes

**Release Date:** [Current Date]

This marks the initial release of the WellSync AI Dashboard, a comprehensive application for real-time well monitoring, fault simulation, and AI-assisted operations.

## Key Features Implemented (Sprints 1-15):

*   **Project Foundation:** Next.js 14 project setup, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, PNPM.
*   **Supabase Backend:** Project creation, CLI integration, database schema (wells, parts, inventory, faults, chat_history, fault_embeddings), pgvector extension.
*   **UI & Layout:** Core application layout, global styles (Tailwind CSS), Shadcn/UI integration (Button, Card, Badge, Select, Dialog, Table, etc.).
*   **Homescreen:**
    *   5x6 grid display of well cards.
    *   Data fetching from Supabase.
    *   Filtering toolbar (Camp, Formation, Status).
    *   Real-time well status updates via Supabase Realtime.
*   **Fault Simulation:**
    *   "Trigger Fault" dialog in the toolbar.
    *   Backend endpoint to log faults and update well status.
*   **Well Detail View:**
    *   Dynamic routing (`/well/[id]`).
    *   Split-screen layout displaying detailed well information.
    *   Sortable fault history table for the specific well.
*   **GenAI Chat Assistant:**
    *   Chat panel UI with message input and display.
    *   Integration with Cohere Command A model.
    *   Conversation history storage and retrieval per well (`chat_history` table).
    *   Contextual information (well details, recent faults) provided to the AI.
    *   Markdown rendering for AI responses.
*   **Semantic Fault Search:**
    *   Automatic fault embedding generation via Supabase Edge Function (Cohere Embed v3) and Database Webhook.
    *   PostgreSQL RPC function (`search_faults`) using pgvector for similarity search.
    *   Frontend API route (`/api/search_faults`) integrating embedding, search, and Cohere Rerank v3.
    *   `/search` command integration in the chat panel.
*   **AI Workflows (Tool Calling):**
    *   Cohere tool schemas defined for `order_part` and `dispatch_part`.
    *   Backend simulation endpoints (`/api/orders`, `/api/dispatches`) including inventory checks/updates.
    *   Tool calling integrated into the main chat API route.
    *   Confirmation messages provided in chat upon workflow completion.
*   **Real-time Inventory:**
    *   Real-time subscription to the `inventory` table (primarily logged in chat panel for now).
*   **UI Polish & Finalization:**
    *   Refinements based on design specifications.
    *   Hover states and transitions.
    *   End-to-end testing of core flows.
    *   Code cleanup and documentation updates (README.md).

## Known Issues / Deferred Items:

*   Cross-browser and thorough performance testing were deferred.
*   A minor ESLint warning exists for a `useEffect` dependency in `ChatPanel`.
*   See `sprints/tech_debt.md` and `sprints/backlog.md` for specific items deferred or planned for future enhancements.
